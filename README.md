A* and IDA* implementation with 3 different heuristic functions in python


Question:

Implement A* and IDA* search to solve the 8-puzzle problem. One of the heuristics you need to implement is taking the approximation function ha(n) = 0 which leads to a breadth first search. You need to think of three more heuristics and code them. Take a random set of inputs and also compare the performance of the heuristics. Performance measures will be number of nodes expanded and the time taken for complete execution of each of the heuristics.
